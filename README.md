halfspace
=========

Python module to deal with stress (and strain, eventually) in an elastic 
halfspace due to loads, faulting, etc.

Currently, two main things are well implemented: Calculating stresses in a
halfspace due to surface loading (especially topography), and projecting
stresses onto planes (faults...) in the halfspace.

In the future, this will be updated to include stress and strain calculations
from dislocations (Okada, 'Meade' triangular dislocations), Mogi-style
pressure sources, etc.

But right now I don't need them.
